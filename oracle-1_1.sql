# analytic functions
"""
row_number analytic function to assign consecutive
numbers 1, 2, 3 â€¦ in descending order of yr_qty, in effect giving the row w/ the highest yr_qty the value 1 in rn.
This happens for each beer because of the partition by, so there will be a row w/ rn=1 for each beer. These rows I keep w/ the where
clause in line 35.
