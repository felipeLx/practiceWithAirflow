use the same start w/ and connect by as Listing 4-1, but the filter on connect_
by_isleaf in line 13 makes the output contain only the leaves of each branch.
By using connect_by_root in lines 2 and 3, I get the desired effect in this output that 
p_id is the top-level packaging_id, while c_id is the lowest-level contains_id.
But this is unfortunately not supported w/ the connect by syntax, where prior 
only can be used on the table columns and expressions w/ these, not on column 
aliases of the se_lect list. If I try this modification, I get an error: ORA-00904: "QTY_MULT": 
invalid identifier
